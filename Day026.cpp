//787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
//There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

//You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

 //Constraints:

// 1 <= n <= 100
// 0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
// flights[i].length == 3
// 0 <= fromi, toi < n
// fromi != toi
// 1 <= pricei <= 104
// There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
// 0 <= src, dst, k < n
// src != dst
