// 427. Construct Quad Tree

// Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent the grid with a Quad-Tree.

// Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.

// Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

// A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

// val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
// isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.
  
   

// Constraints:

// n == grid.length == grid[i].length
// n == 2x where 0 <= x <= 6
