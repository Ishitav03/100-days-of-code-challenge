// You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

// Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.
  
  
//   Constraints:

// 1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4
// 1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10^4
